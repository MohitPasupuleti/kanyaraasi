How to Optimize SQL Queries

This document contains general information about SQL query optimization techniques.

Best Practices:
1. Use indexes on frequently queried columns
2. Avoid SELECT * and specify only needed columns
3. Use JOIN instead of subqueries when possible
4. Consider query caching for repeated queries
5. Analyze query execution plans

Example Query:
SELECT user_id, username, created_at
FROM users
WHERE status = 'active'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 100;
